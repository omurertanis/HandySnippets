# HandySnippets 

**HandySnippets** is a collection of small but handy functions designed to make your life easier as a developer. These utilities cover various common tasks that frequently pop up in everyday coding, helping you save time and effort. Each function is clean, simple, and easy to use.

## Projects

### 1. **TrimUrlExtraSlashes**

The **TrimUrlExtraSlashes** project provides a utility function to clean up URLs by removing unnecessary slashes (`/`). This is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic URL generation or integration between systems where URLs might accumulate redundant slashes, potentially causing errors or inconsistencies.

#### Example

```csharp
string rawUrl = "https://example.com//path//to///resource";
string cleanedUrl = TrimUrlExtraSlashes(rawUrl);

// Output: "https://example.com/path/to/resource"
```

#### Features
- Trims multiple consecutive slashes in a URL, leaving only single slashes.
- Maintains the correct structure of URLs, including protocols (`http://`, `https://`).
- Simple to use and easily integrated into any C# project.
